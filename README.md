<h1>Layout Spider-poster</h1>
<h2>LINK: https://jakubm1999.github.io/Layouting/index.html</h2>
I made a poster which I call "Spider-poster" because it was heavly inspired by
Spider-man. I hope everything is fine and that I showed everything that I needed to show. :)

Also I know that I could use one link for all the fonts but when I figured that out 
I allready did most of my CSS and it would just complicate things so I pasted 3 diffrend
links for three diffrend fonts.
